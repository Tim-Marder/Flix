### Notes
I continue to receive the following error in the console upon building the app:
**2020-09-26 21:56:18.408687-0400 Flix[6571:286683] [] nw_protocol_get_quic_image_block_invoke dlopen libquic failed**
I learned from the Slack channel that this may be just an issue with the new version of XCode, and that the application works fine even if it continues to show up.
